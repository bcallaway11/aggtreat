Description: Implements the methodology from Caetano, Caetano, Callaway, and Dyal (2025)
    "Causal Inference for Aggregated Treatment." Provides tools to diagnose and address
    problems that arise when a treatment variable aggregates multiple underlying
    sub-treatments, including classification of congruent and incongruent sub-treatment
    pairs, computation of minimally incongruent weights via linear programming,
    estimation of aggregate average treatment effects (AATT) and aggregate marginal
    average treatment effects (AMATT+), and a regression weight decomposition.
    Also replicates all quantitative results from the paper's empirical application.
